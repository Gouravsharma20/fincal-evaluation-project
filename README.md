# CRM / Team Management App

A React-based CRM / Team Management application. This README includes quick setup steps and the project admin credentials for local development/testing.

> ⚠️ **Security warning:** Storing real credentials in a repository or README is insecure. Only use these credentials for local development or demo purposes. For production, use environment variables, a secrets manager, or GitHub Actions/Secrets. Remove or rotate these credentials before publishing the repo.

---

## Admin credentials (for local/dev use only)

* **Admin email:** `Gouravsharma20a@gmail.com`
* **Admin password:** `Gourav@1234`

---

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file (recommended) and add any required environment variables.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

5. Sign in using the admin credentials above (local/dev only).

## Recommended safer approach

Instead of keeping credentials in this README, consider:

* Creating a `.env.example` with placeholders (do **not** commit real secrets):

```env
REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com
REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
```

* Adding a proper `.env` to `.gitignore` and storing the real values there locally.
* Using a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for production.
* If you need CI credentials, use GitHub Actions Secrets or your CI provider's secret store.

---

## Notes

* Remember to change or remove the sample admin credentials before sharing or publishing the repository.
* If you want, I can also:

  * Add a `.env.example` file to the repo.
  * Show how to configure authentication to read admin credentials from environment variables.
  * Encrypt or obfuscate credentials for demo builds.
